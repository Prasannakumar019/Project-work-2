# Time series prediction using N-BEATS model
Small description about the project like one below The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

# About
Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize the financial landscape. With its volatile nature, predicting the price of Bitcoin has become a challenging yet enticing endeavor for investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike.In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning and state-of-the-art forecasting techniques to predict the future price of Bitcoin. We employ the N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series) model, a neural network architecture specifically designed for time series forecasting tasks.
## Features
Implements advance neural network method.
A framework based application for deployment purpose.
High scalability.
Less time complexity.
A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.
## Requirements
The hardware and software requirements for running a project involving Bitcoin price prediction using the N-BEATS model in TensorFlow and Streamlit are as follows:

Hardware Requirements:
1. CPU: A multicore processor, preferably with multiple cores, to handle the computational workload efficiently.
2. GPU (Optional): A GPU with CUDA support can significantly accelerate deep learning computations, especially for training large models like N-BEATS.
3. RAM: Sufficient RAM (at least 8GB, preferably more) to accommodate the data loading, preprocessing, and model training processes.
4. Storage: Adequate storage space to store the historical Bitcoin price data, model checkpoints, and any other project-related files.

Software Requirements:
1. Operating System: The project should be compatible with major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. Python: The project is developed using Python programming language, so Python (version 3.6 or higher) needs to be installed.
3. TensorFlow: TensorFlow (version 2.x) is required for implementing the N-BEATS model and performing deep learning tasks.
4. Streamlit: Streamlit (latest version) is used for creating the web application interface for interacting with the model and displaying predictions.
5. Additional Python Libraries: Other Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn may be required for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation.
6. Development Environment: An integrated development environment (IDE) like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code can be used for writing and running the Python code.
7. Internet Connection: An active internet connection may be required for downloading additional libraries, updates, and accessing online resources related to cryptocurrency data and research.

By ensuring that the hardware and software requirements are met, developers can effectively set up the environment for running the Bitcoin price prediction project using the N-BEATS model in TensorFlow and Streamlit.
